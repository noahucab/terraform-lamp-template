# Provisioning a AWS instance using Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

As part of our improving our workflows and automating repeatable steps in our processes, this code will provision a web server without going through tedious steps when setting your web server instance with the GUI. Streamlining our processes would help us focus on the business process and on how we can solve the problems that are repeatable in nature.

In this code, it will setup a LAMP-stack based server. All the necesary toolings and libraries will be installed when you execute the code or template.

## Getting Started

Before you can run the code in the following sections, you need to download and install the follwoing:

1. [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

## Important Note:

This is an initial documentation. If you notice there are some steps missing or any suggestions (which is I would highly recommend) that we need to add with the current setup, you can message me and lets collaborate to improve this template and documentation.
